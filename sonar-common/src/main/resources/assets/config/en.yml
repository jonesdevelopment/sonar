# You can connect Sonar to a database to keep verified players even after restarting your server
# Note: IP addresses are saved in plain text. You are responsible for keeping your database safe!
# However, IP addresses cannot be traced back to players as Sonar uses UUIDs instead of usernames
database:
  # Type of database Sonar uses to store verified players
  # Possible types: NONE, MYSQL
  type: NONE
  # URL for authenticating with the SQL database
  url: localhost

# Every new player that joins for the first time will be sent to

verification:
  # When should Sonar verify new players?
  # Possible types: ALWAYS, DURING_ATTACK, NEVER
