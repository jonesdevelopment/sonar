# Which language should Sonar use for all configurations?
# For this to take effect, restart your server or reload Sonar.
#
# Values will not be translated if you change your language
# when all configuration files already exist.
# If you still want all configuration files to be translated,
# you have to reset the configuration, messages, and webhook settings.
#
# You can view a full list of valid language codes here:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes
# If a translation does not exist yet, Sonar will use English (en)
#
# If you set this option to "system", Sonar will use the system language.
# Please keep this file unchanged if you don't know what you're doing.
language=system
