  # If enabled, the player will be transferred back to the origin server
  # after successfully passing the bot verification.
  # This feature was introduced by Mojang in Minecraft version 1.20.5
  # https://docs.jonesdev.xyz/administration/configuring-sonar/configuring-the-verification/using-1.20.5+-transfers
  transfer:
    # Should Sonar transfer the player to the origin server (instead of kicking them)?
    # For this to work, you must enable the feature in your server's configuration.
    # Additionally, you might want to reduce the amount of login rate-limiting
    # performed by Velocity or other proxies/plugins, as this might prevent the
    # player from being transferred correctly.
    # If your server allows Bedrock players to join via Geyser, make sure to set up
    # TransferTool for Geyser, so Bedrock players are redirected to the correct server.

    # Which server should Sonar transfer the player to when the verification is passed?
